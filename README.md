# Trillo - All-In-One Booking App

This project is part of the [Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/) by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann). The website design and structure were provided as part of the course curriculum, and I did not design the website from scratch. The project's primary purpose is to practice and apply the concepts learned during the course.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo of the project [here](https://superuser-gump.github.io/Trillo/).

## Description

In this project, we present "Trillo," a fictional all-in-one booking app. The core concept behind Trillo is to provide users with a unified platform for booking hotels, flights, cars, and tours, simplifying their travel planning experience.

The project places a strong emphasis on Flexbox layout, CSS animations, and the integration of SVG icons for an enriched user experience.

### Project Details

While this project doesn't implement the full functionality of the app, it focuses on crafting the user interface (UI) for Trillo. The UI design showcases the following essential features:

- **Header**: The header includes a logo, a search bar for hotel searches, and user-related icons such as bookmarks, chat, and user name.

- **Navigation**: Users can navigate between hotel, flight, car rental, and tour sections with a visually appealing navigation menu.

- **Hotel Overview**: The hotel section provides an overview of a specific hotel, featuring images, the hotel's name, star ratings, location, and a list of features.

- **Hotel Reviews**: Real user reviews are showcased, complete with user photos, names, dates, and ratings.

- **Booking Section**: Users can book rooms with a call-to-action button that includes a hover effect for enhanced interactivity.

The design is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, making it accessible on various devices.
